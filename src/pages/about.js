        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Having been busy working in politics and campaigning all my life, it
          wasnâ€™t until Covid lock down that I was able to sit down in London and
          paint Xmas cards to all my family and friends. Some on traditional
          themes, others simply of the view from my window which is over the
          Thames through the London Eye to Big Ben.
        </p>
        <p>
          In answer to bewildering times, I have found joy in painting totally
          spontaneously and achieving tangible and often beautiful outcomes that
          those close to me seem to enjoy and appreciate.
          <p>
            I paint mainly with palette knives in oil and acrylic, mainly post
            card abstracts layering colour upon colour always with no
            pre-conceived idea of how a painting with turn out. Experimenting
            with dripping, pouring, splashing, spraying and other techniques
            continues apace.
          </p>

            Exploring red, orange, yellow and pink hues of the sunsets across
            the London skyline, sea scenes inspired by my love of azure water
            and the occasional beautiful horse or dog also make me very happy.
            Quentin Blake is a true inspiration in giving me courage to try
            these things.

            Spending time in Provence has inspired so many painters with its
            incredible light and colours. Now lucky myself to spend nearly half
            the year there the greens, lavenders, ochres and sharp blue skies
            inspire me every day. I am only just beginning to try and capture
            some of the many beautiful scenes around me in Vaison la Romaine.
